gitflow-repo-report
===================

An awesome way to visualise which branches are active, which should be
merged, etc. Useful if you have a lot of git repositories using git flow
and you want to avoid forgetting about feature branches and similar.


Getting started
---------------

* Just run ```bundle install```
* ```ruby gitflow-repo-report.rb``` launches the application, probably at localhost:4567

The "bundle install" command will hopefully install everything you need,
such as Sinatra (see http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html), rack, rack-
protection and tilt, using bundler for Ruby. If you do not have Ruby
installed, or if you are not using a UNIX-like system, please get your
shit together.
